                    I'm (he/him) an old (23 y/o) 6th year @ UBC majoring in
                    Computer Science, Biological Sciences & Earth, and Ocean
                    Sciences. I switched into this program from Biology
                    in January 2020 with the intent to pursue software
                    engineering as a career, and after a 3 year journey, 
                    I am currently a SWE Intern @ LinkedIn on the
                    ML Infra - Deep Learning team.
                    I also previously interned at BlackBerry and Holmetrics before
                    I interned @ LinkedIn

                    I never considered CS to be something I would pursue
                    full-time, but instead something on the side for fun.
                    However, I realized Biology was wasn't truly what I wanted
                    to do as a full-time career (and it was kinda giving me
                    depression)

                    I was having dinner with a friend of mine (who now works as
                    a SDE @ Amazon) and he made me register for a CS course
                    while I had a mouth full of rice. His argument was: "If
                    you're not even enjoying yourself right now, what do you
                    have to lose to make the jump?" I had already been
                    interested in CS prior (took AP CS in highschool, made my
                    own website for photography prior) and was really interested
                    in being able to create a product I or someone could use. So
                    I just said, screw it and registered. It ended up being one
                    of my favourite courses I have taken at UBC and ultimately
                    led me to make the jump.

                    I really like listening to music while I work. When I'm not
                    working, live music makes it even better (ILLENIUM Ascend
                    Tour/Throwback Sets were amazing) I'd love to share with you
                    the music I like and want to hear what you like. Open to
                    anything. I attended EDC Las Vegas 2022, and saw 
                    Porter Robinson and Illenium twice that week. I
                    also went to EZOO NYC 2022 (Martin Garrix, Porter, Subtronics, Seven Lions, SLANDER)
                    and Second Sky 2022 (Porter, RL Grime, Virtual Self b2b G Jones, Skrillex) in the Bay Area.

                    You can probably catch me in my spare time just really doing
                    random things. My projects that I worked with that won
                    awards (hubble and my research paper) I literally just
                    decided I wanted to do it because why not. Moral of the
                    story is just do what you want and try new things and see
                    what happens I guess.
